= Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works really fine with WordPress 3.3!
It also works great with WP 3.2 - and also should with WP 3.1 - but we only tested extensively with WP 3.3 and 3.2. So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.
